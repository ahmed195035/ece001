<h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p>Introduction for Artificial Intelligence the increasing advancements in technology are feared to diminish the demand for human involvement in several tasks. Paradoxically, this very evolution is helping us understand human behavior better, faster and more systematically. We, as consumers, are willingly sharing information about ourselves, to simplify our lives and help us make our interaction with the Internet of Things more seamless.:</p>

Artificial Intelligence or AI is intelligence exhibited by machines. The surge in technology has made the use of Al in the world of fashion ubiquitous. Brands are using Al in three core business-to-consumer interactions; customer service, path to purchase and marketing. Brands are using Al to update existing methods of marketing and merchandising. The trailblazing progress in Al, readiness of brands to adopt this rapidly growing technology, and our willingness to share data are changing the way we shop. It is expected that by 2020, 85% of interactions with brands will be automated, possibly with customer response systems that combine speech recognition technology with cognitive computing to simulate more human-realistic interactions.:</p>

Augmented Reality is another field of technology which is blurring the line between what is real and what is generated digitally by computers. It enables us to visualize things which are not present, by virtually enhancing our surroundings and by creating immersive experiences.
